# Wordle Game

This is a simple and interactive Wordle game built using Flutter. The game allows users to guess a 5-letter word within a limited number of attempts. It provides real-time feedback for each guess and changes colors to indicate whether letters are correctly placed, present in the word, or absent altogether.

## Features

- Play Wordle with a 5-letter word.
- Real-time feedback on guesses (color-coded for correct, present, or incorrect letters).
- Word size and number of attempts can be customized.

## How to Play

1. Click on the letter keys to input your guesses.
2. After each guess, the tiles will change colors:
   - Green for correctly placed letters.
   - Yellow for letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.
   - Gray for letters that are not in the word at all.
3. You have 6 attempts to guess the word correctly.
